== Description ==

Show a floating box on every page that make visitors required to choose a qookie level. After choosing and authorizing a level the information is logged in the database (on installing, a table will be created, on uninstalling this table will be removed).

You can adjust the complete layout (position, floating, background color, transparency, border radiusses and so on) on the settings page. Other layout properties can ofcourse be adjusted in your theme's CSS. If you need any help, just contact me.

The plugin is developed in English but I added a language file for my fellow Dutch users with initial values. The screenshots on the tab here are in Dutch (also the admin) but don't worry when you have an English version of Wordpress the admin will be just that (except for my English mistakes if there are any, please notify me if you see one!).

To see a working frontend version go to my website: [MultiMediaMonster](http://www.multimediamonster.nl "MultiMediaMonster") (Dutch)
